1. From the "Sharing iP code quality feedback" in GitHub, I was told that the apply method in Parser.java is too long.

ChatGPT: I consulted ChatGPT on my existing apply method and get recommendation on how to improve.
It suggested that I can use a single split to get cmd + rest, then a switch.
I proceeded to refactor the code myself and achieve the same output with a shorter length of code.
This made the code cleaner and neater, adhering to SLAP.

2. Consulted chatgpt to add Javadocs comments after doing a few manually.

ChatGPT: Generated similar Javadoc comments that adhere to the course syntax.
This saved quite a lot of time because there are many public methods and class to add Javadoc.

3. Consulted chatgpt on some other ways to handle errors from my existing handling. I have handled some errors but would wan to know what are the other ways to handle errors.

ChatGPT: Explained what errors there might be missing and what I have to do to handle errors gracefully.
An example would be my getResponse() method in Yang.java, where I needed to handle errors more gracefully.
