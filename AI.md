1. From the "Sharing iP code quality feedback" in GitHub, I was told that the apply method in Parser.java is too long.

ChatGPT: I consulted ChatGPT on my existing apply method and get recommendation on how to improve.
It suggested that I can use a single split to get cmd + rest, then a switch.
I proceeded to refactor the code myself and achieve the same output with a shorter length of code.
